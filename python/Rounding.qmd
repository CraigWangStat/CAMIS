Python has a built-in **round()** function that takes two numeric arguments, *number* and *ndigits*, and returns a floating point number that is rounded version of the  number upto the specified number of decimals.

The defaultnumber of decimal is 0, meaning that the function will return the nearest integer.


```{python}
# For integers
x= 12
print(round(x))
 
# For floating point
x= 12.3
print(round(22.7))  
 
# if the second parameter is present
 
# when the (ndigit+1)th digit is =5 
x=4.465
print(round(x, 2)) 
   
# when the (ndigit+1)th digit is >=5 
x=4.476
print(round(x, 2))   
   
# when the (ndigit+1)th digit is <5 
x=4.473
print(round(x, 2))


```

** Output **
