# Background

A model of the dependence of binary variables on explanatory variables. The logit of expectation is explained as linear for of explanatory variables. If we observed $(y_i, x_i),$ where $y_i$ is a Bernoulli variable and $x_i$ a vector of explanatory variables, the model for $\pi_i = P(y_i=1)$ is

$$
\text{logit}(\pi_i)= \log\left\{ \frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right\} = \beta_0 + \beta x_i, i = 1,\ldots,n 
$$ 

The model is especially useful in case-control studies and leads to the effect of risk factors by odds ratios.
