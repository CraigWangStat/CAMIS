# Meeting minutes

**Team Announcements**

Min-Hua Jen, Gave birth to twins -everyone is doing well !

Harshal volunteered to be our Social Media Rep / co-ordinate our social media posts.

Role consists of:

1)  Helps to come up for ideas for blogs/posts. Examples could include, if someone writes content on MRMM, you ask them to write a short description on what they've done including link to their work on the website, or for example, once the white paper is final, one of us will write a blog post to advertise it.  MOlly's poster prize at PSI conference etc !

2)  Chases people up who said they'd write a blog to ensure we are marketing our work in a timely manner.

3)  Ensures that when you receive content (blog/posts), that it's sent to all the key contacts for organizations/Societies (See end of minutes for list)

**White Paper Update** No comments from Public review. [here](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Deliverables/Under+Review/White_Paper_V6_11May23+(1).pdf) 
Any last comments from the group? If not we will proceed to publish through PHUSE.

**Website progress: Christina** 

Substantial content been added in the last month.
Once key area we'd like to progress on though is MMRM.  @ben do you need help?

Lyn - To create a FAQ doc for the website. Make sure it references available material elsewhere so it doesn't become out of date quickly. PSI AIMS will create github training which we can utilize to onboard statisticians.
