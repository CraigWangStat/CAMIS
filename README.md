# CAMIS

In 2021, PHUSE identified that a working group was needed to investigate and document differences in analysis results when you use different software.  The Clinical Statistical Reporting in a Multilingual World (CSRMW) collaboration (Rimler et al.) was set up to investigate such differences and create a framework for investigation and documentation of the findings in a single repository (WHITE PAPER).  This group have recently rebranded as Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software (CAMIS), creating a repository with associated repository contribution guidance. Its aim is to invite wide collaboration to document similarities and differences found in analysis method implementations using a wider set of software than just SASÂ® and R. This open access repository should save substantial time for individual researchers having to investigate complex methodological differences.  The repository should provide a vital resource for all industries and academics, who find results non-reproducible when they attempt to apply the same analyses in different software.
